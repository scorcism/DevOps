  <summary>SDLC - software development life cycle</summary>

- software development life cycle.

- It is a process used by the software industry.

- It is a set of standards followed in the software industry to design, develop, and test.

- The end goal is to deliver a high-quality product.

- For developing any new feature in the organisation, we follow some steps, which are:

- **_Planing, Defiing, Desiging, Building, Testing, Deploying, and Planning_** _Cycle structure_

- **Planning + Requirements Gathering**
- Most Important
- Plan for the new features, whether they are required or not. 
- Requirements: Gather the requirements about the project use case.
- Suppose you are working to add a new category to the shop, so in plaining, you will decide if it is required or not, and in requirements, you will decide what is the best suit for that category.

- **Defining + Desigining**
- Defining -> Here, you clearly define the requirements in terms of documents. 
- Documents are the software requirements specification documents, which include all the data as part of the planning phase.
- Designing: very critical phase, here we do high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD).

- **Building, Testing, and Deployment** (Devops-centric)


- **Building** _Developers_
- Developing: code writing After code is done, it is stored in a central repository.


- **Testing** QA Engenniers
- The codes that were written by the developer are tested here. The application that is stored in the git repo is taken and deployed on a server. Then the QA team takes care of testing the software.

- **Deployment**
In this phase, we promote the application to production.
